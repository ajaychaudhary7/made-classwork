# Project Plan

## Title
Malware Prediction.

## Main Question
1. How can we predict a Windows machineâ€™s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that machine.?

## Description
Malware attacks against windows operating system has been a long time problem. Main reason for this is the ease of usage of windows and lack of
technical understanding of the user. This project starts with cleaning, feature engineering, structuring the data for machine learning algorithm 
usage and apply them to predict the probability for infectious machine detection.

## Datasources
Data source for this specific problem is Kaggle, a well-known platform for data science competitions and datasets.

### Datasource1: Kaggle
*  Train Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/microsoft-malware-prediction/data?select=train.csv
*  Test Data URL : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/microsoft-malware-prediction/data?select=test.csv
* Data Type: CSV

Datasource1, referred to as Kaggle, comprises two distinct CSV files available on Kaggle. These files contain essential columns such as Product Name, Engine Version, App Version, and more. The purpose of these datasets is for training and testing in the context of the malware detection problem. The structured data within these CSV files serves as the foundation for our analysis and machine learning model development.
