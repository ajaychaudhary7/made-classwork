# Microsoft Malware Detection : Data preparation and EDA

## Project Overview
This projects aims to analyze and process the data provided by Microsoft for malware prediction. The project tackles high memory issues first and then moves onto cleaning and exploratory data analysis to prepare the data to fit Machine Learning/ Deep Learning models directly. Project also shares insights gained from the data about the main causes of the malware spread and which kind of devices are more likely to be affected.


## Dataset
Dataset used in this project is from Kaggle competition of the same name, [Microsoft Malware Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/microsoft-malware-prediction/data). Dataset comprises information about the OS type, Antivirus information, Platform, Touch or Non touch devices etc about the machines and the label in HasDetections which is a binary value describing if a malware was detected on the machine or not.
